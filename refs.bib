abstract = {This paper reports a new structural method to mathematically represent and quantify a tissue for the purpose of automated and objective cancer diagnosis and grading. Unlike the previous structural methods, which quantify a tissue considering the spatial distributions of its cell nuclei, the proposed method relies on the use of distributions of multiple tissue components for the representation. To this end, it constructs a graph on multiple tissue components and colors its edges depending on the component types of their endpoints. Subsequently, it extracts a new set of structural features from these color graphs and uses these features in the classification of tissues. Working with the images of colon tissues, our experiments demonstrate that the color-graph approach leads to 82.65{\%} test accuracy and that it significantly improves the performance of its counterparts.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel image analysis methodology for automatically distinguishing low and high grades of breast cancer from digitized histopathology. A set of over 3,400 image features, including textural and nuclear architecture based features, are extracted from a database of 48 breast biopsy tissue studies (30 cancerous and 18 benign images). Spectral clustering is used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature set. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used (1) to distinguish between cancerous and non-cancerous images, and (2) to distinguish between images containing low and high grades of cancer. Classification is repeated using different subsets of features to compare their performance. The system achieves a 95.8{\%} accuracy in distinguishing cancer from non-cancer using texture-based characteristics (Gabor filter features), and 93.3{\%} accuracy in distinguishing high from low grades of cancer using architectural features. In addition, we investigate the underlying main-fold structure on which the different grades of breast cancer lie as revealed through spectral clustering. The manifold shows a smooth spatial transition from low to high grade breast cancer.},

abstract = {The current method of grading prostate cancer on histology uses the Gleason system, which describes five increasingly malignant stages of cancer according to qualitative analysis of tissue architecture. The Gleason grading system has been shown to suffer from inter- and intra-observer variability. In this paper we present a new method for automated and quantitative grading of prostate biopsy specimens. A total of 102 graph-based, morphological, and textural features are extracted from each tissue patch in order to quantify the arrangement of nuclei and glandular structures within digitized images of histological prostate tissue specimens. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify the digitized histology slides into one of four different tissue classes: benign epithelium, benign stroma, Gleason grade 3 adenocarcinoma, and Gleason grade 4 adenocarcinoma. The SVM classifier was able to distinguish between all four types of tissue patterns, achieving an accuracy of 92.8{\%} when distinguishing between Gleason grade 3 and stroma, 92.4{\%} between epithelium and stroma, and 76.9{\%} between Gleason grades 3 and 4. Both textural and graph-based features were found to be important in discriminating between different tissue classes. This work suggests that the current Gleason grading scheme can be improved by utilizing quantitative image analysis to aid pathologists in producing an accurate and reproducible diagnosis},

@article{Gurcan2009,
abstract = {Over the past decade, dramatic increases in computational power and improvement in image analysis algorithms have allowed the development of powerful computer-assisted analytical approaches to radiological data. With the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners, tissue histopathology slides can now be digitized and stored in digital image form. Consequently, digitized tissue histopathology has now become amenable to the application of computerized image analysis and machine learning techniques. Analogous to the role of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) algorithms in medical imaging to complement the opinion of a radiologist, CAD algorithms have begun to be developed for disease detection, diagnosis, and prognosis prediction to complement the opinion of the pathologist. In this paper, we review the recent state of the art CAD technology for digitized histopathology. This paper also briefly describes the development and application of novel image analysis technology for a few specific histopathology related problems being pursued in the United States and Europe.},

@article{He2012,
abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the image analysis techniques in the domain of histopathology, specifically, for the objective of automated carcinoma detection and classification. As in other biomedical imaging areas such as radiology, many computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems have been implemented to aid histopathologists and clinicians in cancer diagnosis and research, which have been attempted to significantly reduce the labor and subjectivity of traditional manual intervention with histology images. The task of automated histology image analysis is usually not simple due to the unique characteristics of histology imaging, including the variability in image preparation techniques, clinical interpretation protocols, and the complex structures and very large size of the images themselves. In this paper we discuss those characteristics, provide relevant background information about slide preparation and interpretation, and review the application of digital image processing techniques to the field of histology image analysis. In particular, emphasis is given to state-of-the-art image segmentation methods for feature extraction and disease classification. Four major carcinomas of cervix, prostate, breast, and lung are selected to illustrate the functions and capabilities of existing CAD systems. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Colorectal adenocarcinoma originating in intestinal glandular structures is the most common form of colon cancer. In clinical practice, the morphology of intestinal glands, including architectural appearance and glandular formation, is used by pathologists to inform prognosis and plan the treatment of individual patients. However, achieving good inter-observer as well as intra-observer reproducibility of cancer grading is still a major challenge in modern pathology. An automated approach which quantifies the morphology of glands is a solution to the problem. This paper provides an overview to the Gland Segmentation in Colon Histology Images Challenge Contest (GlaS) held at MICCAI'2015. Details of the challenge, including organization, dataset and evaluation criteria, are presented, along with the method descriptions and evaluation results from the top performing methods.},
